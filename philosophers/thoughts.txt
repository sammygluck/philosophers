	=================

	1.a: Death of a philosopher:
	So, what are the options: option a: the philosopher himself anounces his death. This option I don't like because if 
	the philo is stuck it can't move on. So it must be in an external thread. Either a thread inherent to the philo himself, or 
	a general thread. I think we have to go with the second. It also means that the second the philo is dead, it can't be 
	eating anymore afterwards. So before we eat, sleep, etc. we need to check if the guy is dead.

	1.b: Shared variable mutexes:
	The question here is if a mutex is necessary for variables which are only written by one and read by others. Since mutation
	by others isn't possible, do we need a mutex?
	Another question: what are the shared mutexes in this case? A few suggestions: all_alive, last_meal, eat_count

	1.c: Fairness:
	Fairness, we've decided we're going to do by dividing the group into two groups, namely the even group and the uneven group.
	Each group is going to start to eat at different times. My hesitations: how long to wait. It can't be absolute, since eating
	time is also dynamic. So, it must be relative to perhaps eating time. Also, will the fact that the last philospher picks up
	his fork differently affect this process?

	1.d: Deadlock avoid:
	I want to use the last philo picks up different approach. Is this the best?

	1.e: Cleanup when finished:
	What to keep in mind: making sure all malloced stuff is freed properly. Also making sure that all threads end nicely etc.

	1.f: Error stuff:
	Make sure to exit upon error where appropriate. Make sure to free upon error. Make sure to catch all errors.

	1.g: The optional parameter:
	if it's activated, we have to increase the times the philo eats after he eats
	
	
	
----------------------------------------

current situation:
	1. The main issue
	When running the code with any parameters, it seems to start, but unfortunately
	it doesn't continue to the amount of necessary runtimes. It might start correctly, but why doesn't it
	wait for the join to be activated. What is causing this code not to finish to the end? It's not clear.
	Have any of the variables been changed? That is the question. I'm not sure what to make of this. 
	2. Debugging solutions
	What can be done to debug the issue? 
		a. ChatGPT
		I can use the chat to run through my code and check it through properly.
		b. Manual checking
		Manually checking through the code is another possibility. 
		c. Comparing with another repository
		I can also compare to another known depository, which I'll probably try to do
	Using these techniques, hopefully I'll have a broader perspective on the issue at hand.
